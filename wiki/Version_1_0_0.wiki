== Burned-Area Version 1.0.0 Release Notes ==
Release Date: September 6, 2013

=== Downloads ===

* Burned Area source code - available via the [http://code.google.com/p/burned-area/source/checkout Burned-Area Google Projects Source] link

=== Installation ===
  # Install dependent libraries - HDF-EOS GCTP, HDF4, HDF-EOS2, TIFF, GeoTIFF, JPEG, SZIP, ZLIB, Boost, and OpenCV.
  # Set up environment variables.  Can create an environment shell file or add the following to your bash shell.  For C shell, use 'setenv VAR "directory"'.

  # Modify the OpenCV code in modules/ml via the patch files that are provided in the src/boosted_regression directory.  Then rebuild OpenCV with the patched files.  The patches were generated by using `diff -Naur $original_file $modified_file`
    * gbt.cpp  --> cd modules/ml/src; patch < {BA_base}/src/boosted_regression/opencv_patches/gbt.cpp.patch
    * ml.hpp  --> cd modules/ml/include/opencv2/ml; patch < {BA_base}/src/boosted_regression/opencv_patches/ml.hpp.patch
    * Rebuild OpenCV with the patched files
  # Checkout (from Google burned-area project) and install source files
{{{
cd {BA_base}/src/seasonal_summaries
make (make -f Makefile.static for static builds)
make install

cd {BA_base}/src/boosted_regression
make (make -f Makefile.static for static builds)
make install
}}}
This will create several executable files and Python scripts under $BIN(tested in the gcc compiler)

* Note that the Python scripts and C++ code rely on GDAL command-line executables, so GDAL will need to be installed and available in the $PATH.

=== Dependencies ===
  * GCTP library
  * TIFF library
  * GeoTIFF library
  * HDF4 library
  * HDF-EOS2 library
  * JPEG library
  * ZLIB library
  * SZIP library
  * Boost library
  * OpenCV library (modified with the patches from the boosted regression src directory)
  * GDAL command-line utilities
