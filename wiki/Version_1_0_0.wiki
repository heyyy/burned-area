#summary Version 1.0.0 (initial release) of the burned area ECV software.

== Burned-Area Version 1.0.0 Release Notes ==
Release Date: September 6, 2013

=== Downloads ===

* Burned Area source code - available via the [http://code.google.com/p/burned-area/source/checkout Burned-Area Google Projects Source] link

=== Installation ===
  # Install dependent libraries - HDF-EOS GCTP, HDF4, HDF-EOS2, TIFF, GeoTIFF, JPEG, SZIP, ZLIB, Boost, and OpenCV.
  # Set up environment variables.  Can create an environment shell file or add the following to your bash shell.  For C shell, use 'setenv VAR "directory"'.  Note: If the HDF library was configured and built with szip support, then the user will also need to add an environment variable for SZIP include (SZIPINC) and library (SZIPLIB) files.
{{{

  # Checkout (from Google burned-area project) and install source files
{{{
cd ledapsSrc/src
make
make install
make clean
}}}
This will create a list of executable files under $BIN<br />
lndapp lndcal  lndpm  lndsr  lndsrbm.ksh sixsV1.0B
cmrbv1.0  compadjn  comptemp  geo2xy SDSreader3.0 xy2geo
(tested in gcc and gfortran compiler)

* Note that if the HDF library was configured and built with szip support, then the user will also need to add "-L$(SZIPLIB) -lsz" at the end of the library defines in the Makefiles.  The user should also add "-I$(SZIPINC)" to the include directory defines in the Makefile.

* Note that new cloud mask program (lndsrbm) calls command 
"ncdump" which is a standard HDF command. This release includes 
a linux version ncdump command in the bin directory. You need to replace the ncdump program if you run from a different OS system. If you don't want to run optional lndsr-based cloud mask (lndsrbm), you will not need the ncdump program.

  #: Setup environment
{{{
export ANC_PATH="directory_saved_ancillary_files"
(or in c shell use 
setenv ANC_PATH "directory_saved_ancillary_files")
}}}
  #: Test - Download Landsat files and then run following commands separately
{{{
lndpm <Landsat_meta_file>
lndcal <lndcal_input_text>
lndsr <lndsr_input_text>
lndsrbm.ksh <lndsr_input_text>
}}}
Or simply run the combined commands to generate all (includes lndsrbm)
{{{
do_ledaps.csh <Landsat_meta_file>
}}}
Create a file called do_ledaps.csh in your $BIN directory.
{{{
#! /bin/csh -f

if $#argv != 1 then
    echo "Usage: do_ledaps.csh <Landsat_MTL_file>"
    exit
else
    set meta_file = $argv[1]
    set meta = `echo $meta_file | sed -e 's/.txt//' -e 's/_MTL//' -e 's/.met//'`
endif
}}}
  #: Run LEDAPS modules
{{{
$BIN/lndpm $meta_file
$BIN/lndcal lndcal.$meta.txt
$BIN/lndsr lndsr.$meta.txt
$BIN/lndsrbm.ksh lndsr.$meta.txt
}}}
  #: Check output
{{{
lndcal.*.hdf: top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance in HDF format
lndth.*.hdf: thermal brightness temperature in HDF format
lndsr.*.hdf: surface reflectance in HDF format
(each file is also associated with a ENVI header file that contains geographic
information)
}}}
