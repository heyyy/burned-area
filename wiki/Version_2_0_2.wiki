=== Data Postprocessing ===
After compiling the espa-common raw_binary libraries and tools, the convert_espa_to_gtif and convert_espa_to_hdf command-line tools can be used to convert the ESPA internal file format to HDF or GeoTIFF.  Otherwise the data will remain in the ESPA internal file format, which includes each band in the ENVI file format (i.e. raw binary file with associated ENVI header file) and an overall XML metadata file.

    # Modified the main do_burned_area script to double-check if the ‘config’ directory is already available, in the event of race conditions while using multiple processors.  Also updated the model hash table to specify the models desired by the Burned Area team for processing various path/rows.  This table is still incomplete, and the default is to use the mountain west model.
